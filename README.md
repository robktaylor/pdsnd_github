This project uses 3 different .csv files, each representing a city:
Chicago, New York City and Washington. Each .csv file has data from a bike share
program from the corresponding city. The Python bikeshare.py file imports the
.csv file data from all 3 cities, then requests a set of data search
parameters so that specific bike share user statistics may be presented.

### Files used
Data files: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv
Python file: bikeshare.py

### Credits
